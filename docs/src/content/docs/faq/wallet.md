### Warning of "no wallet available"

I'm getting a warning line in WebGUI and/or log file:\
`Failed to get reward address from wallet: no wallet available`

Farmer needs a wallet address to send potential rewards to. It is a warning that no farmer reward address has been set, and there are no wallets created that farmer can default its rewards to.

If you really are farming with plots, make sure farmer is sending rewards to correct address. You can get information about creating wallets and setting farmer reward address in the [Getting Started](../../guides/getting-started/) guide.
