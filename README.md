# mmx-node

_“ MMX &ndash; fast, low cost, feature rich, decentralized &ndash; with tokenomics of an actual currency ”_

A blockchain written from scratch, doing most things differently.

Website: https://mmx.network \
Whitepaper: [MMX_Whitepaper_290125.pdf](https://docs.mmx.network/MMX_Whitepaper_290125.pdf)

Design
- Variable token supply governed by consensus (1 block = 1 vote)
- High throughput L1 with consistent block interval (500 TPS, 10 sec)
- Novel Smart Contract VM for ease of development and high performance
- Energy efficient Proof of Space and Time
- Block reward is adjusted to stabilize price, a key property of any currency
- Minimum transaction fee to allow large block size without spam
- Limited external library usage to keep codebase clean and secure
- No pre-mine, no ICO, no investors
- Account based model

Elements
- High performance C++ code (can handle over 1000 TPS easily)
  - Transactions are executed in parallel when possible
- Custom high-level VM for Smart Contracts
  - Native support for variants, arrays, maps, and objects
  - Unified memory with automatic persistence and state updates
  - A restricted subset of JavaScript is compiled into bytecode
  - Average of two machine instructions per line of code
- Native token support (no "approvals" needed, NFT = 1 mojo)
- Smart contract offer based trading (fixed price, OTC)
- Liquidity pool swap based trading (AMM, multi-fee tiers, similar to Uniswap v3)
- ECDSA signatures for seamless integration (same as Bitcoin)
- Custom blockchain database engine (much faster than RocksDB or LevelDB overall)
- Adaptive SHA256 VDF to govern block interval
- Feature rich Node with built-in Block Explorer, Wallet, Market, Swap, RPC, etc

## Release Notes

### Mainnet

- Transactions are no longer limited to odd or even blocks
- Validators are now previous block winners, starting at 24 blocks prior
- Increased validator count to 33
- Committing blocks is paused when proofs found is less than 80% expected
- VDF checks during sync are obsolete
- Added maximum proof limit of 20 per block
- Faster difficulty adjustment
- Changed VDF reward payout interval to 20 blocks (with each being 0.2 MMX)
- Changed VDF block infusion delay to 1
- Added remote call recursion limit of 3
- Added maximum contract dependencies of 5

### Mainnet-RC

- New VDF scheme:
  - Single VDF stream with infused Timelord reward
  - No longer possible to steal or disable Timelord reward
  - Proof challenges are now deterministic, apart from random infusions every 256 blocks on average
  - If a proof's hash passes a filter, it will change future challenges and update difficutly
  - Timelord rewards are now paid out every 50 blocks in bulk to fastest TL
  - There are no more dummy blocks (blocks without proof)
- VDF segment count is now dynamic, depending on TL speed:
  - This means VDF verify time wont increase unless the GPU is at it's compute limit
  - Previously VDF verify time would increase even if the GPU is not maxed out, due to fixed parallel work
  - CPU verify is unchanged
- All proofs found are now included in blocks
  - Yields accurate netspace estimation
  - Supports extra security (see below)
- Recent blocks are further secured via a new voting scheme:
  - Up to 31 farmers who found a lesser proof (didn't make a block) recently can act as a validator
  - These validators vote on the first block received per height
  - Only blocks made with the best known proof are voted for
  - This prevents reverting recent blocks via double signing in most cases
  - Previously it was always possible to replace the current peak via double signing, this is now impossible
  - Previously if a farmer got lucky to find multiple blocks in a row:
    - He could also replace them at will until another farmer found the next block
    - This is now also impossible, unless the farmer has close to 50% or more netspace
- 50% TX fee burn (to avoid farmer spam attack + allow supply contraction)
  - Project fee is taken from burned amount
- Virtual Plots have been removed due to an attack vector
  - Together with the un-bounded block reward voting it was possible to generate a heavier chain with minimal real netspace
- Improved block reward voting: Majority vote out of 8640 blocks wins, 1% change up/down per day, >50% participation required.
- Offer contract now supports price update (at most every 1080 blocks)
- Pooling support + Reference Pool implementation
- Improved difficulty adjustment algorithm (targets 4 proofs per block)
- VM improvements to reduce transaction costs
- Send amount can now be up to 128-bit (was limited to 64-bit before)
- Mint amount can now be up to 80-bit (was limited to 64-bit before)
- Added block timestamps
- Smart Contract unit test framework

### Testnet12

- Fixed Virtual Plots, they now win blocks at the expected rate. On TN11 it was ~20 times less.
- Fixed block reward formula, average tx fee is subtracted from minimum reward again.

### Testnet11

- New plot format:
  - k29 to k32 max
  - 9 tables
  - very low compression only
  - CPU farming only
  - SSD and HDD plot types
  - Old format no longer valid
- Transaction output memo support
- Block reward voting support
- Swap algorithm improved
- Swap fee levels changed to: 0.05%, 0.25%, 1% and 5%
- Using zstd compression for network traffic
- NFT plot support (testing only)
